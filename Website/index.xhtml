                <p>This website was created as part of the Computational Methods in Humanities course at the University of Pittsburgh. The goal of this project was to analyze dissidence in rock music from the Soviet Union. The criteria for analysis can be
                found under the <strong>Criteria</strong> tab. The lyrics can be accessed from the <strong>Lyrics</strong> tab; the methodology for selecting the song sample is also located under the <strong>Lyrics</strong> tab. The <strong>Analysis</strong> tab contains the results of our
                analysis, and the <strong>More</strong> tab contains references and additional information.</p>
