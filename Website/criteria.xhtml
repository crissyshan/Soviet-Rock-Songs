                <h1>~Criteria for XML Analysis~</h1>
                <p>We analyzed songs using XML to manually mark up the lyrics. We searched for the
                    following elements in the lyrics:</p>
                <br />
                <ul>

                <h1>~Sample Selection~</h1>
                <p>Our sample was mostly selected from the "Top of the Pops" list published annually
                    by The Moscow Komsomol newspaper. The way this chart was compiled was through
                    letters from readers; thus, although not very objective, this ranking was
                    somewhat less censored than the official sales numbers and could not be
                    manipulated by selling two-in-one records to boost a state-sponsored artist's
                    popularity. We also threw in some hand-picked songs for years where this chart
                    was sparse, lacking musicians remotely resembling rock music, or not published
                    at all. This was done by considering which musicians were lacking in the sample,
                    the debut years of musicians, and the legacy of the songs as reflected in
                    post-soviet rankings of rock music. Although our list inevitably includes some
                    musicians which could be labeled "estrada", or state-sponsored, for the most
                    part the list is comprised of acts that made their way from the bottom up,
                    starting in underground "apartment concerts" and progressing to mainstream
                    popularity through word of mouth. Due to time constraints, we were limited in
                    the number of songs we could analyze; our list misses many important songs and
                    musicians as a result, but it still reflects the wide variety of sub-genres
                    within rock in the Soviet Union.</p>
