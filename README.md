# Soviet-Rock-Songs
Computational Methods
Crissy, Jack, Misha --
A project researching the identifiable political/national/Soviet character of rock songs from the late Soviet period (1980-1990), with particular focus on the level of "dissident sentiment" (or lack thereof!) and the use of figurative/Aesopian language to convey this sentiment.
