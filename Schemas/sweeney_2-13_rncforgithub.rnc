# I repurposed the RNC that was in our 'planningfiles' folder (shannon_0122_relaxng-02.rnc) and added the few tags 
# that were included in the dissidence doc. This of course is just a first attempt at it, just to get the ball rolling, but 
# I want to discuss tomorrow whether or not i've done this correctly. I made the new tags:
# outlook, crit (for party criticism), aesop_lang (for Level of aesopian language), and soc_real (for Degree of abiding by socialist realism)
# i made them all attributes, though I am not sure if they should stay that way. If that is a problem, we'll discuss it tomorrow in our meeting
