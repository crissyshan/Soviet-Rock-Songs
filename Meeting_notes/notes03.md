# Meeting Notes: 2/14

- Going over pulling and pushing from GitHub
- Assigning Jack to look at Mongolia
- Talking about schema -- move on to decide we should start with an xml file to start on schema
- Look at "Ne strelyai" 
        - Close (hand-tagging) vs. distant reading (automated)
        - Outlook: postive/negative (metadata)
    - Crissy: start a spread sheet with words within the song lyrics and associating them with what or keyword you think it's associated with. 
    - Ideas: war, the people/nation, consciousness, indicating happiness (smile, etc.), home, patriotism (Soviet vs. nation)
- Crissy & Misha: for next week, each mark up ONE xml file; then, go mark up the other person's text while in communication with each other. Next week, we will reconcile the ideas we both have in order to move forward with the schema. 
- Have keywords/references as separate elements; use attributes for more specific references
- Could we use topic modeling? Check the link in issues page to see some simple topic modeling.
- Discussed the question of what our sample should be, how we will decide/justify those decisions, if we should use random sampling, etc.
