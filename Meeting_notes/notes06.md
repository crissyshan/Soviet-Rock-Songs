# Notes for 3/6

## Updates:

- Misha found a book with every chart of hits from the Soviet Union

   - Two charts matter: Komsomolskaya Pravda (reader choice) and Song of the Year (party choice)

## Practical considerations:

- Need to budget our time

   - Sample selection: size? (thinking for close reading, 1 song from each of the 2 charts for each year 1980-1990)
   
   - Auto tagging needs to be reduced to something more simple

- To do

   - Misha: Buy book, create corpus from book
   
   - Crissy and Misha: Finish close reading over spring break
   
   - Jack: Website (make CSS and develop the homepage)
